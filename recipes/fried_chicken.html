  <h3>-Description</h3>
  <p>Fried chicken is a popular dish made by coating chicken pieces in a seasoned batter or breading and then deep-frying them until crispy and golden brown. The chicken is typically marinated in buttermilk or a blend of spices before frying, enhancing its flavor and tenderness. The crispy exterior contrasts with the juicy, tender meat inside, creating a satisfying texture. Variations of fried chicken can be found worldwide, with each culture adding its unique twist, from Southern-style buttermilk fried chicken in the United States to Korean fried chicken with its signature sweet and spicy glaze. It's often served with sides like coleslaw, mashed potatoes, or biscuits.</p>

    <h3>-Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Marinate the chicken:
        Place the chicken pieces in a bowl.
        Pour buttermilk over the chicken to cover.
        Add salt, pepper, and any other preferred seasonings.
        Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.</li>
      <li>Prepare the coating:
        In a shallow dish, mix all-purpose flour with salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using).</li>
      <li>Heat the oil:
        Pour cooking oil into a deep skillet or heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of about 1-2 inches.
        Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 350째F (175째C).</li>
      <li>Coat the chicken:
        Remove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk, letting the excess drip off.
        Dip each piece into the seasoned flour mixture, coating thoroughly and shaking off the excess.</li>
      <li>Fry the chicken:
        Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil.
        Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
        Cook for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165째F or 74째C).</li>
      <li>Drain and serve:
        Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.
        Let it rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
      </ol>
